# DL-NN-Handling-imbalance-Dataset

Credit card dataset has 2 categories: fraud and not fraud
Fraud entries are extremely less compared to not fraud category. 
Using machine learning algorithms or generic EDA will not give correct preditions. 
In this, I'm using Dense and Sequential model from keras
Neural network is created.
